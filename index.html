  <p class="mountainsParagraph">
    Mountains are large landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, 
    typically having steep slopes and significant height differences from their base to their peak. 
    They are formed through geological processes such as tectonic plate movements, volcanic activity, and erosion. 
    Mountains can be found on every continent and are often part of mountain ranges.
    They influence climate, weather patterns, and provide habitats for diverse flora and fauna.
